# BIOF509_ML
# The jupyter notebook file contains the code for creating a model for predicting guideRNA efficiencies, it is written in an OOP format 
# The two excel files are the input data with the y axis in two different formats. "_continuous" means the data is in a continous format from 0-100 showing the ediitng efficiency; whereas "_binned" means the editing score are binned on a scale from 0-10. For training and testing the model, the first column of the csv file will be the y label and columns [2:] are the features of each gRNA in a binary vector.
